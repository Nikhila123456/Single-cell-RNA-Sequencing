Integration process integrated the samples using SCT method after finding integartion anchors. 
Additionally, 
1. Active gene set scores for epithelial cell types has been found out.
2. Spearman correlation matrix has been genretad between the groups in each individual cluster
3. Sub clustering has been done for pooling pure epithelial cells( basal and luminal) 
4. Unique markers in each cluster has been identified to annoatate the clusters
5. Different plots( violon, dot, UMAPs) have been plotted
